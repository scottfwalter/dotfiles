## Installation
  0. Install Brew
  1. Ensure Apple's command line tools are installed (`xcode-select --install` to launch the installer).
  2. [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html):

     1. Run the following command to add Python 3 to your $PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`
     2. Upgrade Pip: `sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip`
     3. Install Ansible: `pip3 install ansible`

  3. Clone or download this repository to your local drive.
  4. Run `ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml` inside this directory to install required Ansible roles.
  5. Run `ansible-playbook main.yml --ask-become-pass` inside this directory. Enter your macOS account password when prompted for the 'BECOME' password.

> Note: If some Homebrew commands fail, you might need to agree to Xcode's license or fix some other Brew issue. Run `brew doctor` to see if this is the case.


### Running a specific set of tagged tasks

You can filter which part of the provisioning process to run by specifying a set of tags using `ansible-playbook`'s `--tags` flag. The tags available are `dotfiles`, `homebrew`, `mas`, `extra-packages` and `osx`.

    ansible-playbook main.yml -K --tags "dotfiles,homebrew"
