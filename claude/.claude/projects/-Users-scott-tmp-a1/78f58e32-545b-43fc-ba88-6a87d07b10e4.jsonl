This indicates that Angular 21 will include the removal of HammerJS integration as a major breaking change.\n\n## Current Angular 20 Status (May 2025)\n\nAngular 20.0.0 is here and Angular 20.0 is expected in the week of May 26, 2025. Angular 20 has already been released in May 2025 with significant features including:\n\n- Zoneless change detection is the future of Angular change detection. Zoneless is no longer experimental, but not yet stable. It is now in developer preview and, to reflect that, the provider has been renamed from provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection to provideZonelessChangeDetection.\n- The structural directives ngIf, ngFor and ngSwitch are now officially deprecated in favor of the control flow syntax.\n- In Angular v20 we graduated all the fundamental reactivity primitives to stable including signal, effect, linkedSignal, signal-based queries, and inputs.\n\n## Expected Angular 21 Features and Timeline\n\nBased on Angular's typical release schedule, Angular 21 would be expected around **November 2025** (approximately 6 months after Angular 20's May 2025 release).\n\n### Key Features Expected in Angular 21:\n\n1. **HammerJS Removal**: The HammerJS integration has been deprecated. HammerJS has not been updated for the past 8 years so the team is planning to remove all HammerJS entities from the framework in the future.\n\n2. **Signal-based Forms**: Angular is exploring signal-based forms, with Angular 20 likely introducing an experimental API. Based on the 2024 survey and 2025 roadmap, this approach aims to become the new default for form management.\n\n3. **Selectorless Components**: Angular 20 might introduce selectorless components, aiming to eliminate double imports and simplify component usage. While an RFC is planned for 2025, an experimental version in Angular 20 is possible.\n\n4. **Stable Zoneless Change Detection**: Given that zoneless is currently in developer preview in Angular 20, it may reach stable status in Angular 21.\n\nNote that specific Angular 21 features haven't been officially announced yet, as the Angular team typically focuses on the current and immediate next release.
