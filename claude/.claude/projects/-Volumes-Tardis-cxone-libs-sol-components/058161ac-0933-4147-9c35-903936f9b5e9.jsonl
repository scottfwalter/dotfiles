She began coding at age 7 and now leads a growing team focused on making academic data more accessible with LLMs. Investors include On Deck and Pioneer Fund. Her story is inspiring a new generation of young tech founders.\n\n**Cybersecurity Concerns:**\nCybersecurity researchers have uncovered new malicious AI variants based on WormGPT, including strains built on Grok and Mixtral models. These tools are being used to automate phishing, malware creation, and other cyberattacks with advanced precision. The discovery shows how open-source LLMs can be weaponized for nefarious purposes. Experts are urging stronger AI safety and security protocols.\n\n**Apple's Major Tech Announcements:**\nApple introduced Metal 4 with native AI capabilities built directly into their graphics API. This breakthrough allows Mac developers to run AI computations on GPU without cloud dependencies. Mac applications can now compete with NVIDIA CUDA-based systems for AI workloads.(no content)Apple unveiled a massive $500 billion investment over four years to build AI infrastructure in the United States, including dedicated chip manufacturing and 20,000 R&D jobs. This creates significant job opportunities in AI development and strengthens Apple's position against NVIDIA and Google in the AI space.\n\n## CES 2025 Highlights\n\n**Major Product Launches:**\nSamsung unveiled OLED displays with a massive 500Hz refresh rate. Meanwhile, its South Korean rival LG revealed the LG G5 and M5 OLED TVs with a big brightness boost and new AI features.(no content)Lenovo stunned with the world's first \"rollable\" laptop.(no content)The biggest news has to be Nvidia dropping its all-new RTX 50-series graphics cards, which are bringing unfounded levels of GPU power to desktops and laptops.\n\n**Smart Glasses Innovation:**\nThere's been significant innovation in the Micro OLED technology to project imagery onto AR glasses. It's an exciting time for smart glasses!\n\n## Recent Security and Development Issues\n\n**NPM Security Incident:**\nA sophisticated supply chain attack targeted 847 popular npm packages in late June, affecting millions of downloads through compromised maintainer accounts. Popular React utilities, date manipulation tools, and validation packages were compromised. Immediate actions required: Update all dependencies, rotate API keys, check git history for suspicious commits, and run security scans on production systems.\n\n## Current Market Trends\n\n**August 2025 Tech Updates:**\nMicrosoft Authenticator is deleting passwords, Google Pixel Watch 4 price and promo deals leaked, Microsoft warns of Russian hackers planting fake antivirus software in embassy attacks, and UK firms are investing heavily in new tech.\n\nThese developments show 2025 continues to be dominated by AI advancements, cybersecurity challenges, and major hardware innovations from companies like Apple, Samsung, and Nvidia."}]},"uuid":"617013e7-3aca-45ee-a7b8-eac941f7a3cd","timestamp":"2025-08-07T18:14:53.259Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"tech news today latest 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Y7ctBs8L7QRGRWPKG6ta8v","content":[{"title":"Latest AI Breakthroughs and News: June, July, August 2025 | News","url":"https://www.crescendo.ai/news/latest-ai-news-and-updates"},{"title":"National security meets next-gen tech at Disrupt 2025 AI Defense panel | TechCrunch","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/national-security-meets-next-gen-tech-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2025s-ai-defense-panel/"},{"title":"News Archive | August 2025 | TechRadar","url":"https://www.techradar.com/news/archive"},{"title":"CES 2025: From vacuums to pet robots, AI takes centre stage at world's largest tech fair | Euronews","url":"https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/01/07/ces-2025-from-vacuums-to-robots-ai-takes-centre-stage-at-largest-tech-fair"},{"title":"Top 10 Tech News That Changed Everything This Month (July 2025) - A Developer's Perspective - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/shiva_shanker_k/top-10-tech-news-that-changed-everything-this-month-july-2025-a-developers-perspective-3ka0"},{"title":"CES 2025 LIVE: All the biggest tech and gadget news | Tom's Guide","url":"https://www.tomsguide.com/news/live/ces-2025-live-latest-news"},{"title":"Best tech of CES 2025: The weird gadgets we don't want ...","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/tech/best-tech-ces-2025-weird-010359650.html"},{"title":"5 quantum computing stocks investors are targeting in 2025 - TheStreet","url":"https://www.thestreet.com/technology/5-quantum-computing-stocks-that-could-soar-in-2025"},{"title":"The best tech and gadgets we found on CES 2025 Day Two","url":"https://www.engadget.com/general/the-best-tech-and-gadgets-we-found-on-ces-2025-day-two-110005772.html"},{"title":"My 2025 tech resolutions: ditching X, avoiding AI, and more","url":"https://www.fastcompany.com/91246801/my-2025-tech-resolutions-ditching-x-avoiding-ai-and-more"}]},"Based on the search results, here are the latest tech news highlights for August 2025:\n\n## Recent AI and Technology Developments\n\n**Latest AI Breakthroughs (June-August 2025):**\nA 16-year-old entrepreneur, Pranjali Awasthi, is making headlines as the founder of Delv.AI, a â‚¹100 crore ($12M) AI research startup.
