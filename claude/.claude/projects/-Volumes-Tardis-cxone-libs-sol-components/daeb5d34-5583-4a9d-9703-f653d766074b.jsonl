York-based law firm Kasowitz LLP today [announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250807231105/en/Fintiv-Files-RICO-and-Trade-Secret-Misappropriation-Suit-Against-Apple-Stemming-from-Alleged-Theft-of-Mobile-Wallet-Technology-Used-to-Create-Apple-Pay) that it is filing a lawsuit against Apple on behalf of its client, Texas-based company [Fintiv](https://fintiv.global/), over alleged theft of mobile wallet technology used to create Apple Pay.\n\n![apple pay feature dynamic island](https://images.macrumors.com/t/_9GM9AHCXiI1nk0W9LldY-35QXk=/400x0/article-new/2023/11/apple-pay-feature-dynamic-island.jpg?lossy)\nIn a press release, the law firm said the complaint accuses Apple of violating U.S. federal and state [RICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act) and trade secret laws.\n\nAccording to the press release, the complaint alleges that Apple approached Fintiv's predecessor CorFire between 2011 and 2012, and received confidential technical information under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Fintiv believed that Apple planned to license CorFire's mobile wallet technology, but said it instead stole the confidential information and later hired away key CorFire employees, before launching Apple Pay in 2014.\n\nThe lawsuit is being filed in a Northern Georgia district court.\n\n\"Apple's theft of Fintiv's technology is part of a pattern and practice that Apple has engaged in for years – falsely pretending to partner with companies in order to steal confidential and proprietary information under the guise of a working relationship, and thereafter hiring away key employees, all in order to steal the company's valuable intellectual property and use it to commercialize the business on its own,\" the complaint alleges.\n\nThe complaint cites Apple's \"similar pernicious scheme\" to [steal trade secrets from Masimo](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/apple-appeals-ban-on-blood-oxygen-feature/) to develop the Apple Watch's blood oxygen measuring feature.\n\n*MacRumors* has yet to find the complaint in the U.S. court filing system, so these allegations and quotes are entirely relayed from the press release.\n\nWhile this particular lawsuit in Georgia is new, Fintiv has been waging a legal battle against Apple since 2018, when it filed a patent infringement case against the company in Texas. That case was eventually dismissed, but an appeals court overturned the decision and remanded it to Texas for further proceedings. Earlier this week, a judge in Texas [ruled](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/case-patents-procedure-w-d-tex-12) that Apple did not infringe certain patents, and granted Fintiv's motion to dismiss the remaining claims. Now, the saga will shift to a Georgia court with the filing of this fresh lawsuit.\n\nRelated Roundup: [Apple Pay](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/)\n\nTag: [Apple Lawsuits](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/)\n\nRelated Forum: [Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+](https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134)\n\n[ [40 comments](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-at-center-of-new-trade-secret-lawsuit.2462959/) ]\n\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n![maxresdefault](https://images.macrumors.com/images-new/1x1.trans.gif)![maxresdefault](https://images.macrumors.com/t/_FGko_FuOs5BK7w0kQVBm7hz7h8=/400x400/smart/https://img.youtube.com/vi/L6yCY7CCsQ8/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n### [iPhone 17 Pro Launching Next Month With These 12 New Features](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/iphone-17-pro-launching-next-month/)\n\nTuesday August 5, 2025 6:25 am PDT by [Joe Rossignol](https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/)\n\nThe calendar has turned to August, and that means the iPhone 17 series is just one month away.

York-based law firm Kasowitz LLP today [announced](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250807231105/en/Fintiv-Files-RICO-and-Trade-Secret-Misappropriation-Suit-Against-Apple-Stemming-from-Alleged-Theft-of-Mobile-Wallet-Technology-Used-to-Create-Apple-Pay) that it is filing a lawsuit against Apple on behalf of its client, Texas-based company [Fintiv](https://fintiv.global/), over alleged theft of mobile wallet technology used to create Apple Pay.\n\n![apple pay feature dynamic island](https://images.macrumors.com/t/_9GM9AHCXiI1nk0W9LldY-35QXk=/400x0/article-new/2023/11/apple-pay-feature-dynamic-island.jpg?lossy)\nIn a press release, the law firm said the complaint accuses Apple of violating U.S. federal and state [RICO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act) and trade secret laws.\n\nAccording to the press release, the complaint alleges that Apple approached Fintiv's predecessor CorFire between 2011 and 2012, and received confidential technical information under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Fintiv believed that Apple planned to license CorFire's mobile wallet technology, but said it instead stole the confidential information and later hired away key CorFire employees, before launching Apple Pay in 2014.\n\nThe lawsuit is being filed in a Northern Georgia district court.\n\n\"Apple's theft of Fintiv's technology is part of a pattern and practice that Apple has engaged in for years – falsely pretending to partner with companies in order to steal confidential and proprietary information under the guise of a working relationship, and thereafter hiring away key employees, all in order to steal the company's valuable intellectual property and use it to commercialize the business on its own,\" the complaint alleges.\n\nThe complaint cites Apple's \"similar pernicious scheme\" to [steal trade secrets from Masimo](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/07/apple-appeals-ban-on-blood-oxygen-feature/) to develop the Apple Watch's blood oxygen measuring feature.\n\n*MacRumors* has yet to find the complaint in the U.S. court filing system, so these allegations and quotes are entirely relayed from the press release.\n\nWhile this particular lawsuit in Georgia is new, Fintiv has been waging a legal battle against Apple since 2018, when it filed a patent infringement case against the company in Texas. That case was eventually dismissed, but an appeals court overturned the decision and remanded it to Texas for further proceedings. Earlier this week, a judge in Texas [ruled](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/case-patents-procedure-w-d-tex-12) that Apple did not infringe certain patents, and granted Fintiv's motion to dismiss the remaining claims. Now, the saga will shift to a Georgia court with the filing of this fresh lawsuit.\n\nRelated Roundup: [Apple Pay](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/)\n\nTag: [Apple Lawsuits](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/)\n\nRelated Forum: [Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+](https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134)\n\n[ [40 comments](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-at-center-of-new-trade-secret-lawsuit.2462959/) ]\n\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\n\n## Popular Stories\n\n![maxresdefault](https://images.macrumors.com/images-new/1x1.trans.gif)![maxresdefault](https://images.macrumors.com/t/_FGko_FuOs5BK7w0kQVBm7hz7h8=/400x400/smart/https://img.youtube.com/vi/L6yCY7CCsQ8/maxresdefault.jpg)\n\n### [iPhone 17 Pro Launching Next Month With These 12 New Features](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/iphone-17-pro-launching-next-month/)\n\nTuesday August 5, 2025 6:25 am PDT by [Joe Rossignol](https://www.macrumors.com/author/joe-rossignol/)\n\nThe calendar has turned to August, and that means the iPhone 17 series is just one month away.
